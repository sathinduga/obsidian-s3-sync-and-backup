## Features

- **Bi-directional Sync** — Three-way reconciliation keeps your vault synchronized across devices via S3. Per-file SHA-256 baselines stored locally in IndexedDB detect changes accurately — no cloud manifest required.
- **S3-Compatible Storage** — Works with AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, RustFS, and any other S3-compatible endpoint.
- **End-to-End Encryption** — Optional XSalsa20-Poly1305 encryption with Argon2id key derivation. Encrypts both synced files and backup snapshots. Passphrase can be remembered for auto-unlock on startup.
- **Scheduled Backups** — Full vault snapshot backups with configurable intervals (hourly to weekly). Download any backup as a ZIP from settings.
- **Smart Conflict Resolution** — When the same file changes on two devices while offline, the plugin creates `LOCAL_` and `REMOTE_` copies so you never lose data.
- **Status Bar Integration** — Real-time sync and backup status at a glance, with clickable actions.
- **Flexible Retention** — Automatically clean up old backups by age (days) or number of copies.
- **Plugin Settings Protection** — The plugin's own settings directory is hardcoded-excluded from sync to prevent credential or passphrase leakage.
- **Mobile Support** — Works on iOS and Android. No desktop-only APIs used.
- **Command Palette** — Sync now, Backup now, Pause/Resume sync, and more — all available from the command palette with customizable hotkeys.

## Installation

### From Community Plugins
1. Open **Settings** → **Community plugins**
2. Search for "S3 Sync + Backup"
3. Click **Install** then **Enable**

---

### Manual Installation
1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the [latest release](https://github.com/sathinduga/obsidian-s3-sync-and-backup/releases).
2. Create the folder: `<VaultPath>/.obsidian/plugins/simple-storage-sync-and-backup/`
3. Copy the downloaded files into this folder.
4. Reload Obsidian and enable the plugin in **Settings** → **Community plugins**.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Configure S3 Connection
1. Open **Settings** → **S3 Sync + Backup**.
2. Select your provider (**AWS S3**, **Cloudflare R2**, **Backblaze B2**, **RustFS**, or **Other S3-compatible**).
3. Enter your credentials:
   - **Endpoint URL**: Required for non-AWS providers (e.g. `https://s3.<REGION>.backblazeb2.com` for Backblaze B2).
   - **Region**: Use `auto` for Cloudflare R2; for Backblaze B2 use the region in your endpoint (e.g. `us-west-004`).
   - **Bucket name**: Your S3 bucket.
   - **Access Key ID** & **Secret Access Key**.
   - **Force Path Style**: Only shown for the **Other S3-compatible** provider — AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, and RustFS each use a fixed addressing mode (path-style for R2/B2/RustFS, virtual-hosted for AWS).
4. Click **Test Connection** to verify credentials and bucket access.

### 2. Enable Sync
1. In the **Sync** section, toggle **Enable sync** (on by default).
2. Set the **Sync prefix** (default: `vault`) — this is the S3 folder where your files live.
3. Toggle **Auto-sync** and choose a **Sync interval** (1 min to 30 min, default: 5 min).
4. Enable **Sync on startup** to sync immediately when Obsidian opens.

### 3. Enable Backups (Optional but Recommended)
1. In the **Backup** section, toggle **Enable backups** (on by default).
2. Set the **Backup prefix** (default: `backups`).
3. Choose a **Backup interval** (every hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, daily, every 3 days, or weekly).
4. Enable **Retention** and configure a policy to auto-delete old backups.
5. Use **Backup now** for an immediate snapshot at any time.

### 4. Enable Encryption (Optional)
> ⚠️ **Important**: If you enable encryption, you MUST remember your passphrase. There is no recovery if it is lost.

1. Toggle **Enable end-to-end encryption**.
2. Enter a strong passphrase (minimum 8 characters — a strength indicator guides you).
3. Optionally enable **Remember passphrase** to auto-unlock the vault on startup.
4. Use the **same passphrase** on all devices syncing this vault.

When encryption is enabled:
- All synced files are encrypted before upload to S3.
- All backup snapshots are encrypted (the backup manifest remains plain JSON for metadata).
- Other devices detect the encryption state automatically and prompt for the passphrase.
- Disabling encryption re-uploads all files as plaintext (with a confirmation dialog).

## Permissions and data access

The plugin is a sync and backup tool, so by design it enumerates every file in your vault and then reads / uploads / downloads the files inside your configured sync and backup scope.  This section spells out exactly what each piece of the plugin touches so you can make an informed decision before enabling it.

### What the plugin reads

| API | Why the plugin uses it |
| :--- | :--- |
| `vault.getFiles()` | Enumerates every file in the vault during sync planning and during backup snapshots. Without this the plugin cannot know what to sync or back up. |
| `vault.read()` / `vault.readBinary()` | Reads file content so it can be uploaded to S3. Triggered only for files inside the sync/backup scope (every vault file minus your *Exclude patterns* minus the plugin's own settings directory). |
| `vault.on('create' / 'modify' / 'delete' / 'rename')` | Tracks which files changed since the last sync so the next cycle only re-checks dirty paths. |
| Bulk re-read on encryption toggle | When you enable, disable, or rotate the passphrase, the plugin reads every in-scope vault file and re-uploads it in the new payload format. |

### What the plugin writes

| Destination | What ends up there |
| :--- | :--- |
| **S3** (under your configured **sync prefix**, default `vault`) | A copy of every vault file inside the sync scope. File payloads are end-to-end encrypted when *Enable encryption* is on; plain otherwise. |
| **S3** (under your configured **backup prefix**, default `backups`) | Timestamped full-vault snapshots. **File payloads** are encrypted when encryption is enabled; the per-snapshot `.backup-manifest.json` is **always plaintext** so the plugin can list and inspect backups without the passphrase (it contains file paths, sizes, SHA-256 checksums, the encryption flag, and the originating device ID). |
| **Local vault** (`vault.create` / `vault.modify` / `vault.createBinary` / `vault.modifyBinary` / `vault.rename` / `vault.createFolder`) | Files downloaded from S3 on the receiving end of a sync, plus `LOCAL_*` / `REMOTE_*` conflict artifacts when a file diverged on two devices.  Parent folders are auto-created top-down as needed; the rename API is used to stage `LOCAL_*` conflict copies. |
| **Local vault trash** (via `fileManager.trashFile`) | Files that were deleted on another device and propagated by sync. Honours **Obsidian's** *Files and Links → Deleted files* preference (system trash vs. `.trash/` folder vs. permanent). |
| **IndexedDB** (database `obsidian-s3-sync-journal-{vaultName}`) | Per-file sync baselines (path, hash, size, mtime, ETag) used for three-way reconciliation, plus a destination fingerprint that detects when you reconnect to a different bucket/prefix. Vault-scoped so two vaults on the same device never share state. |
| **Obsidian vault-scoped storage** (key `s3-sync-device-id`) | A randomly generated per-vault device identifier. The same ID is written into every uploaded S3 object's `obsidian-device-id` custom metadata for last-writer attribution, and into the `deviceId` field of every backup manifest. |
| **`data.json`** (Obsidian plugin settings) | All plugin settings (S3 credentials, optional saved passphrase, sync/backup toggles, exclude patterns) plus the last-completed backup timestamp used by the scheduler. The plugin's own settings directory is hardcoded-excluded from sync so this file never leaves your device. |

### What is sent off your device

- **HTTP traffic** goes **only** to the S3 endpoint you configure (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, RustFS, or any other S3-compatible endpoint). The transport scheme matches the endpoint you set — HTTPS for hosted providers; the plugin accepts plain HTTP if you choose it (e.g. `http://localhost:9000` for a local RustFS).
- **No telemetry, no analytics, no error reporting, no update polling.** The Security section below covers the network-use detail.
- **No remote code execution.** The plugin never downloads or evaluates code from the network — all cryptography runs locally in the browser.

### What is *not* read or written

- The plugin does not access the operating system shell, filesystem, or any APIs beyond those Obsidian exposes.
- It does not touch files outside the configured vault.
- It does not contact any host other than the S3 endpoint you configure.

> **Important — Obsidian config files are in scope by default.** Only the plugin's own settings directory (`.obsidian/plugins/simple-storage-sync-and-backup/`) is hard-excluded.  Other files under `.obsidian/` (workspace layout, hotkeys, third-party plugin settings, etc.) are vault files from Obsidian's point of view and are enumerated and synced unless you add them to *Exclude patterns* in settings.  If you do not want those propagated across devices, add patterns such as `.obsidian/workspace*`, `.obsidian/hotkeys.json`, `.obsidian/plugins/**`, etc.  The defaults (`**/workspace*`, `.trash/**`) cover the workspace layout but not other config files.

## Multi-Device Sync

This plugin is designed for multi-device use. Each device gets a unique ID on first run, and all S3 uploads are tagged with the writing device's ID.

**How it works:**
- Each device maintains its own local sync journal (IndexedDB) with per-file baselines.
- On sync, the engine compares local state, remote state (S3), and the last-known baseline to determine what changed and where.
- If the same file changed on two devices while both were offline, a **conflict** is created with `LOCAL_` and `REMOTE_` copies of the file.

**Encryption across devices:**
- When encryption is enabled on one device, other devices detect the encrypted state on next sync and prompt for the passphrase.
- Use the same passphrase on all devices. If the wrong passphrase is entered, the plugin notifies you and clears any saved passphrase.
- Encryption enable/disable operations use an advisory lock to prevent two devices from migrating simultaneously.

## Security

- **Encryption algorithm:** XSalsa20-Poly1305 (via tweetnacl) with Argon2id key derivation (via hash-wasm).
- **Content identity:** SHA-256 fingerprints of plaintext content, stored in S3 custom metadata.
- **Network use:** Outbound network requests go **only** to the S3-compatible endpoint you configure (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, or RustFS) over HTTPS. No third-party services, telemetry endpoints, analytics, or update servers are contacted. The plugin performs the following kinds of network activity, all under your control:
    - **Periodic sync** polls your bucket on a user-configurable interval (default 5 minutes, range 1–30 minutes). Controlled by the *Enable sync* and *Auto-sync* toggles plus the *Sync interval* dropdown in Settings — turning either toggle off stops all scheduled sync traffic.
    - **Periodic backups** snapshot your vault on a user-configurable schedule (default daily, options from hourly to weekly). Controlled by the *Enable backups* toggle and the *Backup interval* dropdown.
    - **Manual operations** (sync now, backup now, test connection, download backup) only run when you invoke them from the command palette, status bar, or settings.
- **No telemetry:** The plugin sends no usage data, error reports, or identifiers anywhere. Disabling sync and backups stops all network activity completely.
- **No remote code execution:** All encryption and hashing runs locally in the browser. The plugin never fetches or evaluates code from the network.
- **Credential protection:** S3 credentials and saved passphrases are stored in Obsidian's `data.json`, which is hardcoded-excluded from sync to prevent leakage.

---

### Testing

The plugin includes 565+ automated tests: unit tests covering sync, encryption, backup, and utility modules, pipeline end-to-end tests, and integration tests against live S3 endpoints. CI runs linting, type-checking, and the full test suite on every pull request.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Does this work on mobile?</strong></summary>
Yes! The plugin works on both iOS and Android versions of Obsidian. No desktop-only APIs are used. Note that mobile operating systems may restrict background activity, so open the app periodically to ensure sync completes.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use this alongside Obsidian Sync?</strong></summary>
It is <strong>not recommended</strong>. Using two sync solutions simultaneously can cause race conditions and data conflicts. Choose one primary sync method.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I restore from a backup?</strong></summary>
Go to <strong>Settings → S3 Sync + Backup → Backup → View backups</strong>, or use the <strong>View backups</strong> command from the command palette. The modal lists the 5 most recent backups — click "Download zip" to export one as a ZIP file. Extract it and manually copy files back into your vault.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why do I see LOCAL_ and REMOTE_ files?</strong></summary>
This means the same file changed on two devices while both were offline (a sync conflict). Open both files, manually merge the content into the original filename, then delete the <code>LOCAL_</code> and <code>REMOTE_</code> copies. The conflict resolves on the next sync.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Are my backups encrypted?</strong></summary>
Yes — when encryption is enabled and the vault is unlocked, all backup files are encrypted before upload. The backup manifest (<code>.backup-manifest.json</code>) is always plain JSON so the plugin can read backup metadata, but it contains only file names, checksums, and the <code>encrypted</code> flag — no file content.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What happens if I forget my passphrase?</strong></summary>
There is <strong>no recovery</strong>. The passphrase is never sent to S3. If you lose it, encrypted files in S3 cannot be decrypted. Always use a password manager to store your passphrase securely.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I change the sync or backup prefix after setup?</strong></summary>
Yes, but existing files under the old prefix won't be moved. The plugin will treat the new prefix as a fresh location. You'd need to manually move or re-sync files if you change prefixes.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What files are excluded from sync?</strong></summary>
By default, <code>**/workspace*</code> and <code>.trash/**</code> are excluded. You can customize this in <strong>Settings → Advanced → Exclude patterns</strong>. The plugin's own settings directory (<code>.obsidian/plugins/simple-storage-sync-and-backup/</code>) is always excluded and cannot be overridden.
</details>
